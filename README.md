# ALGSIM
While studying algorithms and data structures at university, I always found the websites to help understand algorithms often left me more confused after using them. I think this was because of the rudimentary nature of the websites.
With algsim, I am aiming ot creating a more user-friendly and visually appealing platform to learn some of the more confusing topics of computer science

## What is it?
Algsim is a platform to visualise sorting algorithms, search algorithms, graph traversal algorithms and more. Users will search and select an algorithm they wish to learn, and be able to watch interactive simulations of that algorithms. It is a simple frontend web application built using React.
